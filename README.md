# SMR API [![build](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/smr-api/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/smr-api/actions/workflows/build.yml)

The Satisfactory Mod Repository backend API

## Running

If you are under Linux, you will need to install the following packages (or your distro's equivalent):

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential libpng-dev
```

You will also need to generate the GQL server and REST docs via:

```bash
go generate -x -tags tools ./...
```

To start the API, execute:

```bash
go run cmd/api/serve.go
```

### Configuration

Running the API has a lot of pre-requisites.

To run the API, you will need to have a working Postgres, Redis and Storage. There is a dev composefile that you can
start via:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

It is suggested you create a configuration file at `config.json` (but you can also use environment variables).

Main configuration options:

1. Postgres (started with dev composefile)
2. Redis (started with dev composefile)
3. B2 or S3 (or anything S3-compatible e.g. minio (started with dev composefile))
4. GitHub OAuth (https://github.com/settings/developers)
5. Google OAuth (https://console.developers.google.com/)
6. Facebook OAuth (https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)
7. Paseto keys (generated via `go run cmd/paseto/main.go`)
8. Frontend URL (needed for Google OAuth, otherwise can be ignored)
9. VirusTotal API key (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/sign-in)

The config format can be seen in `config/config.go` (each dot means a new level of nesting).
